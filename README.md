# Water Heater
Hacking a water heater to lower its consumption on a limited power source

This product will check continously the electrical consumption, if it exceeds the defined limit, it will lower the consumption of the water heater.
Always have heated water without having to switch it on or off all day specially on generator.
Very efficient if you don't have an electric counter on your generator.

@ToDo:
1-Having multiple Electricity sources, define a limit for each one.
2-Add a temperature sensor to check the water temperature, and limit the consumption above certain temperature on metered source to lower bill.
